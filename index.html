    <h1>My Meeting with Three Minds</h1>
    <p>I set out to understand code — and met three concepts that define the future of technology.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>The First Mind: Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>

    <img src="img/ai.jpg" alt="A conceptual image of general Artificial Intelligence" />
    <p>This was the broadest mind, the parent concept. It spoke of systems that can <span>"think and act"</span> rationally.
      It was the grand
      idea of simulating human intellect.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Second Mind: Machine Learning (ML)</h2>

    <img src="img/ml.jpg" alt="A visualization of data patterns for Machine Learning" />
    <p>This one didn't speak in rules, but in patterns. It consumed vast amounts of data, learning and adapting without being explicitly programmed for every task.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Third Mind: Deep Learning (DL)</h2>

    <img src="img/dl.jpg" alt="An abstract representation of a complex neural network" />
    <p>The final mind was complex, layered like a human brain. It processed information through intricate neural networks, solving problems the others found impossible.</p>
